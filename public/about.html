	    <h3>What is Digital Table?</h3>
	    <p>
	      Digital Table is a platform designed to make playing Tabletop Role Playing Games over the internet easy!
	    </p>
	    <h3>What are Tabletop Role Playing Games?</h3>
	    <p>
	      
	      You may recognize names like "Dungeons and Dragons" or "Pathfinder". These games are examples of tabletop rpgs.
	      I am way too lazy to explain this right now. Go google it.
	    </p>
	    <h3>Do I have to pay?</h3>
	    <p>
	      Nope! Digital Table is a free service. That being said, there are some perks to becoming a donating member of 
	      the Digital Table community. These are all non-essential perks, such as being able to run more games simultaneously,
	      and having extra character sheet templates.
